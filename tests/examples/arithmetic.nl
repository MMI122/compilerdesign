-- NatureLang Example: Variables and Arithmetic
-- Demonstrates variable declaration and basic math

-- Create some number variables
create a number called x and set it to 10
create a number called y and set it to 25
create a number called result

-- Arithmetic using natural words
result becomes x plus y
display result

-- More arithmetic
create a number called product
product becomes x multiplied by y
display product

-- Using symbolic operators too
create a decimal called ratio
ratio becomes y / x
display ratio

-- Combined expressions
create a number called complex_result
complex_result becomes x plus y multiplied by 2
display complex_result
